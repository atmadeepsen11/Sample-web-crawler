A simple web crawler than can parse through web pages and return the details of a particular type.
To find information on the hundreds of millions of Web pages that exist, a search engine employs special software robots,
called spiders, to build lists of the words found on Web sites. When a spider is building its lists, the process is called Web crawling.

Note: !!! Do not use such a code on any website without permission!!!

The website used here is craigslist as it has a huge variety of tags which can be parsed for example, the titles, prices, locations, etc.

Most important library:
Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic
idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
